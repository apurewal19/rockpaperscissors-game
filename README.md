# rockpaperscissors-game

First Iteration

Learned how to add functionality to my game using JavaScript. Basics like variables, boolean statements, functions, and for-loops were utilized in this RPS game.

Second Iteration

Added styling with CSS and used the document object model (DOM) to make the RPS game work on users interface rather then
just the console.
